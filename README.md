## About the App

This app allows users to browse an image gallery and search images according to their tags. They can also click on the selected image to show its back, revealing the tags and whether the image was AI generated or not. Users can also generate their own images by using DeepAI's API. Users can also upload their own images and give them three tags. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
