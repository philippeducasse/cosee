## Cosee App



## About the App

This app allows users to browse an image gallery and search images according to their tags. Users can also upload their own images and give them three tags. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Technologies used

- Typescript
- NextJS
- Tailwind
- Firebase

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine, then install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
## ToDo / Improvements

This app could be enhanced be adding user authentication. In addition, some features are not fully responsive, such as the image size (needs to be refreshed if the browser screen is made smaller). A dark mode would also be nice.
